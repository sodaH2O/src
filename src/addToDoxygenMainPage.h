OPAL is a tool for charged-particle optics in accelerator structures and beam lines. Using the MAD
language with extensions. IPPL (Independent Parallel Particle Layer)
is the framework which provides parallel particles and fields using data parallel ansatz. OPAL is
built from the ground up as a parallel application exemplifying the fact that HPC (High Performance
Computing) is the third leg of science, complementing theory and the experiment. HPC is made
possible now through the increasingly sophisticated mathematical models and evolving computer
power available on the desktop and in super computer centres. OPAL runs on your laptop as well as
on the largest HPC clusters available today.
The OPAL framework makes it easy to add new features in the form of new C++ classes. It comes
in the following flavours:
OPAL-CYCL tracks particles with 3D space charge including neighbouring turns in cyclotrons and
FFAG’s with time as the independent variable.
OPAL-T can be used to model beam lines, linacs, rf-photo injectors and complete XFEL’s excluding
the undulator.
