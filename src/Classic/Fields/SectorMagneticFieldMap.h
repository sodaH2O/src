/** \class[SectorMagneticFieldMap] 
 *
 *  \brief handles field map grids with sector geometry
 *
 *  SectorMagneticFieldMap provides an interface to the 3D interpolator
 *  routines for 3D field maps in a sector geometry. Interpolation is done from
 *  points in (r, y, phi) geometry off of a 3D field map stored in cartesian
 *  coordinates.
 *  - position coordinates are left in polar because it makes the interpolation
 *    easier
 *  - field coordinates are left in cartesian because it means we can avoid
 *    doing a coordinate transformation (tracking is done in cartesian
 *    coordinates)
 *
 *  A constructor is provided which calls the SectorMagneticFieldMapIO class to
 *  generate the field map, and it is expected that this will be the usual way
 *  to generate the map.
 *
 *  The SectorMagneticFieldMap class caches field maps by file name to avoid
 *  multiple loads of the same field map. This cache should be cleared after
 *  running (otherwise we have a memory leak).
 *
 *  Note that the coordinate system used for tracking by Ring (z is up) is a
 *  bit different to that implemented in SectorField (y is up). I perform a
 *  coordinate transformation in the getFieldstrength function to facilitate
 *  this. Note that OpalBeamline has y is up...
 *
 *  SectorMagneticFieldMap enforces that field is hard against the start edge
 *  with no gap. SectorMagneticFieldMap auto-detects any field phi offset and
 *  removes each time it does a field lookup (just an add operation, so fast).
 *  If a phi offset is desired, user must zero-pad field map.
