Changes: 

Add to dummympi.h:
------------------
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

Add to math_lib.h
-----------------
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using std::ofstream;
using std::cout;
using std::endl;

Add to sca_dom.h
----------------
using std::ifstream;


Add to main.cc
--------------
std:: 

cout.setf(std::ios::fixed,std::ios::floatfield);
PARAMETER.open("para.dat",std::ios::in);
DATEI.open("hex.dat",std::ios::out);

Add to printpa.cc
-----------------
std::

Datei->setf(std::ios::scientific,std::ios::floatfield);


Old header files are used in:

source/grid/mgcoeff.cc:  fstream.h 
			 does not need stdio.h
source/grid/grid.cc:     fstream.h

source/domain/sca_dom.cc: 
			   fstream.h strstream.h 
			   and proper flag handling 
			   does not need stdio.h


source/domain/domain.cc: fstream.h 
			 does not need stdio.h
		
Makefile
--------
Add parallel compile feature with native g++. Add LDFLAGS
variable for serial and parallel compiling. Note: with 
mpCC use the serial version of LDFLAGS.
	
# serial version
#CC = g++3.2
#CFLAGS = -g -DnoEXPDEPARALLEL 

# parallel version with special compile script
#CC = mpCC
#CFLAGS = -O -DEXPDEPARALLEL

# parallel version without special compiile script
CC = g++3.2
CFLAGS = -g -DEXPDEPARALLEL -I/usr/lib/mpich/include/

#
# serial 
#LDFLAGS = -lm -L../lib -lexpde

#
# parallel
LDFLAGS = -static -lm -L../lib -lexpde -L/usr/lib/mpich/lib -lmpich 

I did NOT coean up this:
