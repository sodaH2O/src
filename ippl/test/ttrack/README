README for ttrack
Helge Krueger

ttrack is a program to simulate touschek lifetime. See the report for details on implementation.

Files:
dsmc.cpp              The Program, where everthing happens in
Makefile              Makefile run make, needs various libraries as IP^2L.
Doxyfile              File to create doxygen documentation.
GT*                   modified version of gte library
sls-1.dat             Lattice file to simulate the SLS (1 third)
aur-1.dat             Lattice file to simulate Aurora
touscheklifetime.nb   Mathematica Notebook to compute the Touschek Lifetime for Aurora
report/               My report, run pdflatex report.tex
report/presentation/  My presentation, run pdflatex presentation.tex

For LaTeX files various graphics need to be generated.

Data for Figure to Report xxx
=============================

To plot lifetime in gnuplot from filename:
For seminalytic:
plot '< grep analytic filename' u 0:(1/($8 * charge * 3600) w l
For analytic:
plot '< grep analytic filename' u 0:(1/($6 * charge * 3600) w l
For 2 particles:
plot '< grep analytic filename' u 0:(1/($4 * charge * 3600) w l

Figure 2: run dsmc with aur1.dat as input, Voelkel and Classical value from Mathematica notebook.
Figure 3: run dsmc with sls-1.dat (plot semianalytic and analytic)
Figure 4: as above, also plot 2 particles
Figure 5: run dsmc with different number of processors, adjust mesh size.
Figure 7: run dsmc with sls-1.dat scaling the momenta acceptance (accps)
Figure 8: run dsmc with sls-1.dat scaling emittance and bunch shape
Figure 9: run dsmc with aur-1.dat scaling emittance and bunch shape, do the same with Mathematica notebook
