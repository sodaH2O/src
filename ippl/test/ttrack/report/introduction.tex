\section{Introduction}
The aim of this document is to give an overview over what I have done during my time as a summer student at the Paul Scherrer Institut in Villigen. I was there during the summer 2005. My task was to write a simulation for the Touschek Effect in a storage ring, with the goal to do simulations for the ultra low emmitance case.
\subsection{What is the Touschek Effect?}
The effect of electreons being lost from a stored beam due to intra beam scattering is called Touschek Effect. Here transversal momenta is transfered into longitudinal momenta. This effect is amplified by a $\gamma$-factor, causing the electrons to fall out of the momenta acceptance of the storage ring.
\subsection{Description}
Up to now people have used different 2 main different approaches to describe the Touschek Effect. People have derived analytical formulas using different assumptions. For a choice of 2, you can look at section ``Analytical Touschek Effect''. And S. Khan did something similar to our calculations.
