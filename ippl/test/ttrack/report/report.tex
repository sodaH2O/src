  \slsabstract{Single intrabeam scattering of electrons leading to energy changes larger than the energy acceptance (Touschek scattering) is an important mechanism of particle loss in a light source storage ring. The dependance of Touschek lifetime on beam properties (emittance, coupling, bunch length etc.) and energy acceptance can be described by an analytical formula, which has proven to agree well with observations at existing machines. This formula describes an obvious decrease of Touschek lifetime with shrinking emittance, however for ultralow emittance beams, the lifetime should become larger again.\\ This report deals with the modeling of Touschek effect based on macro particles. Different approaches like direct Coulomb scattering and M{\o}ller scattering will be discussed. Results for a simple test lattice and the SLS lattice will be compared to the analytical formula and to measurements done at SLS.

%  During my stay as a summer student, I wrote a simulation to compute the Touschek Lifetime. This document gives an overview over what I did. We also conducted measurements with the SLS to validate my computations.
