So this is the same test as Track 6 but now using the second order for femaXX!!

Tracking data of 5 particles, without Ef, but with Bcav,  Ecav, and with time integration. But now the analytical solutions of the Efield and Bfield are really found by maple using the analytical formula from Roman's Diss, Appendix C.2.
Data of particle with ID 3 is plotted: start postion (1,0.5,0), start velocity = (0,0,0.4*c). The cavity used is box10k!!
