In order to compile the tools sdds2opal and opal2sdds you have to download the source code of SDDS version 3.4
at http://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator_Systems_Division/Accelerator_Operations_Physics/software.shtml#SDDSSource .
Unpack the sources, change to the directory epics/extensions/src/ and then upack the archive SDDSCMakeLists.tar.gz
in this directory. Finally apply the patch SDDS.patch with the command
$ patch -p1 < /path/to/patch/SDDS.patch
Now you can use cmake to compile and install the SDDS library.
